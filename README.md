# Vectorgram Online Diagnostic Engine
*For the early screening of breast cancer through Whole Mammogram Classification*

Vectorgram scales up Breast Cancer Screening capacity using a Deep Neural Network deployed online for automated AI diagnosis from mammogram scans. Using Vectorgram for early Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Kenya will end up saving upto 2.3 Million women's lives that would otherwise be lost to late diagnosis due to the current 42 percent fatality rates.

*Update:
We're organizing the dataset, model images and dependencies for the work we've completed on Vectogram and we'll be bringing it all to it's final home here soon!*
